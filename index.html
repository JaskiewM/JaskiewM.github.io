        <div id="AboutMe">
          Hello and welcome to my webpage! I hope you enjoy your stay and connect with me after learning
          a bit about myself. I have included little snip-bits of info about my experiences, the projects I have been a part of, my resume
          and contact information (phone, email, and LinkedIn).
          <br><br>
          A bit about myself; I am currently a product designer at TDG Transit Design Group
          where I work on the development and redesign of transit lighting fixtures.
          In December 2019 I graduated from the Automotive and Vehicle Engineering Technology
          program from McMaster Universirty. With previous experience in manufacturing and mechanical design,
          I have found my passion in the world of engineering.
          <br><br>Please check out my projects and provide feedback! I love to hear what I can improve on.

            <div id="ProjectOneDisplay1">My capstone project is to develop an autonomous line following walking robot. Utilizing Solidworks, ADAMS, 3D printing, and Arduino,
            myself and two other group members have been able to work on this project from January 2019 until now - must be completed by December 2019. My contributions to the
            project have been the design and calculations of the leg mechanisms, while assisting with the designs of the base and side walls. In addition, I have given design advice
            and recommendations to my group members for how the assembly will fasten together and common practices when using CAD.</div>

            <div id="ProjectTwoDisplay1">This project consisted of myself and a group of three in designing, 3-D printing, and analyzing a hand crank spoiler. I was responsible
              for the designs of the front cover, assembly casing, and the hand crank. Using NX 10, I coordinated the overall shape and size, as well as the mechanics of the
              assembly. Additionally, I assisted with the development of the rack and pinion by calculating thesize and teeth, while also using NX to do a stress analysis on the rack when
              it is in operation.</div>

            <div id="ProjectThreeDisplay1">This project consisted of myself and four others in modelling a Mazda RX-7 13b Wankel engine in Catia V5R19. One group mate and I worked together to
             dissassemble the engine and clean all the components. We distributed parts to each group member for modelling and I focused on the rotor. I learned a lot on the
            necessary steps for modelling complex components as the rotor consisted of many small grooves, seals, and gears. In addition, I worked with team mates that modelled the
          components that connected to the rotor. Once the modelling was finished, our group was able to complete the kinematic motion simulation.

            <div id="ProjectFourDisplay1">In my second year of university, myself and two others had a project to utilize a companyâ€™s requirements for a handcart (required speed
            and dimensions) and design the assembly using SolidWorks. I was responsible for the base, attachments to the base, and the axle. Our goal was to focus on the easy disassembly
            of the cart while also keeping it as lightweight as possible. As a final touch, I designed the two people operating the cart.

            <div id="ProjectFiveDisplay1">I began developing webpages in a digital arts course during highschool. Over the years I learned more about HTML and CSS, and what goes
              into an attractive website. In July 2017, I began creating my own website to outline my projects and skills. Since then I had added and taken away from each style, improving
               my webpage every year. In August 2019, I decided to put more time and effort into the development and made it live using Github. While I'm still making updates and learning,
                I would love to hear what aspects I can change to make my website better! If you have suggestions, get in contact with me and let me know.
