                    <p>
                        Here I would like to talk about my hobbies! Even though 
                        I have many hobbies - such as cycling, tennis, video games,
                        and astrophotography - I will focus on two hobbies
                        that I have consistently put a lot of love and effort 
                        into over the years. One being Dungeons &amp; Dragons, 
                        and the other is skiing.

                    <h3><bold><u>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</u></bold></h3>
                    <p> I love many aspects of the game, but the one that always keeps
                        me coming back is the expression of creativity. Every campaign
                        and each group has such diverse and unique ideas, and I love 
                        bringing new stories and encounters to parties that I play with.
                        Making new friends has also been an amazing experience. I've 
                        been able to solidify friendships and meet new people after 
                        each new group I play with. One campaign we currently have
                        has been going on for over two years, and isn't slowing down.
                    </p><p>
                        Finally, I find that my storytelling and public speaking has
                        improved dramatically. From being nervous to speak to a group
                        of two or three people, to now comfortably being able to manage
                        a party of eight. I have also learned how to understand key plot
                        points in movies and films, and emphasize story elements when
                        storytelling.

                    <h3><bold><u>Skiing</u></bold></h3>
                    <p> Skiing is one of the sports that I have consistently 
                        kept up with my entire life. I started skiing between 
                        the ages of 6 and 10, and immediately fell in love.
                        The aspect of being in nature and the thrills of taking 
                        on challenging slopes are the reasons why I keep going.
                        I have gone with friends, family, and my partner to many
                        parts of North America to ski. My goal is to one day 
                        visit the Swiss Alps and spend a few weeks skiing there. 
                        One area that I'd greatly like to improve in is 
                        snowboarding. I was able to rent a board a few years ago
                        and found the challenge to be so fun, that I'd love to 
                        progress in that field as well.
                    </p>
