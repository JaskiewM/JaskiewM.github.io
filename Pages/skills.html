                                <h4>Unity | C# | GIT</h4>
                                <p>This is a recreation of the Pong game released
                                    back in 1972. This game was done for a weekend
                                    programming session and took less than 48 hours
                                    to complete. The purpose of this two person 
                                    project was to hone our skills in game design, 
                                    version control, and C#.

                                    an interactive horror visual novel about AI 
                                    chatbots. The game was made using the Godot 
                                    Engine which began as a game jam project, and 
                                    slowly grew into more of a short visual novel. 
                                </p>

                                    Self-started and developed to reduce the cost of calculating 
                                    assembly reliability, it has currently 
                                    reduced calculation times by 87.5% and used in
                                    around 5 projects per year, saving $12,500 yearly.
                                    This was made using Quanterion 217-Plus data.
